### Code Review by Sandra Danielsson (based on version 27 Jan, ca 20.30)
  1. Adding the keyword exit; after your header()-functions increases user security, killing the current script before the redirect.
  2. Use snake-case och camelCase in file names as well for readability.
  3. Adding error and confirmation messages helps reducing mistakes and uncertainty.
  4. Good and clear project structure!
  5. The "heading"/help comments in editprofile.php are appreciated and great for navigating. It could be a good idea adding it to other long files as well, such as functions.php
  6. The index.php has a lot of div elements rn, consider using various  semantic elements for accessability.
  7. Signing up: add second field for password so the user knows no typos were made.
  8. Responsive! Design works well both on mobile and desktop
